My personal [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) configuration that I wish to sync between machines.

- `global/` contains .bashrc config intended to be sourced by default.
- `scripts/` contains ad-hoc scripts intended to be run on demand.

## Install
1. Install `nix` on the system.
1. `git clone` repo to $HOME ([.gitignore](.gitignore) is an allowlist by design).
1. Activate Home Manager [(instructions)](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.html#ch-nix-flakes) by `nix run .`

## Usage
1. Make declarative changes in [home.nix](./home.nix)
1. Build and switch to the new configuration by `nix run .`

## Develop
1. Make code changes. ðŸ¤ž
1. Run test jobs in [.github](.github) (e.g. run `act` or `gh workflow run`).
